AI PROJECT GROUP 20

AI STOCK ANALYZER

To run this program WITHOUT Python, please run the "RUN THIS FILE (.EXE)" .exe file on a Windows device. If you want to run this inside your favaourite IDE, set the virtual environment's Python executable to be the main Python interpreter (venv/Scripts/python.exe) and then run the main.py file.

If all else fails, the main dependencies for our program can be installed via these commands:

- pip install yfinance
- pip install pyqt5
- pip install pandas
